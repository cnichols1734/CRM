# =============================================================================
# The IABS document contains pre-filled brokerage information from DocuSeal
# and agent/supervisor info populated from the user profile. The seller only
# needs to provide initials and date during the e-signature process.
#
# This document should be automatically marked as 'filled' when generated
# since all required data comes from the system/user profile.
